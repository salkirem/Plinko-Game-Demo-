Playable  Plinko Game on terminal
Game Concept and Objectives: Plinko is a chance-based game inspired by the popular TV game show "The Price is Right." The core idea of the game is to drop a ball from the top of a peg-filled board and watch it bounce off pegs until it lands in one of several bins at the bottom. The player's objective is to predict which bin the ball will land in and place a wager on that prediction. The game's goal is to successfully predict the ball's final destination and win the corresponding payout.
